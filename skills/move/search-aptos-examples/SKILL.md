# Search Aptos Examples Skill

## Overview

This skill helps you find relevant examples in the official Aptos repository before writing new contracts. **Always search examples first** to follow established patterns.

**Repository:** `aptos-labs/aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/`

**Contains:** 53+ official Aptos Move examples demonstrating best practices

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What You're Building

Categorize your contract:

- **NFTs/Tokens**: NFT collections, digital assets, collectibles
- **Fungible Assets**: Coins, tokens, currencies
- **DeFi**: DEXs, AMMs, lending, staking
- **Governance**: DAOs, voting, proposals
- **Marketplace**: Trading, escrow, auctions
- **Gaming**: Items, characters, game logic
- **Infrastructure**: Registries, configs, utilities

### Step 2: Search Relevant Examples

**Priority Examples by Category:**

#### NFTs & Token Objects
1. **`token_objects/`** - Modern object-based tokens (V2 pattern)
2. **`mint_nft/`** - NFT minting patterns
3. **`nft_dao/`** - NFT-gated governance
4. **`collection_manager/`** - Collection management

**When to use:** Building NFT collections, digital collectibles, tokenized assets

#### Fungible Assets
1. **`fungible_asset/`** - Modern fungible token standard
2. **`coin/`** - Basic coin implementation
3. **`managed_fungible_asset/`** - Controlled fungible assets

**When to use:** Creating tokens, currencies, reward points

#### DeFi & Trading
1. **`marketplace/`** - NFT marketplace patterns
2. **`swap/`** - Simple token swap
3. **`liquidity_pool/`** - AMM pool implementation
4. **`staking/`** - Staking mechanisms

**When to use:** Building DEXs, marketplaces, trading platforms

#### Governance & DAOs
1. **`dao/`** - DAO governance patterns
2. **`voting/`** - Voting mechanisms
3. **`multisig/`** - Multi-signature accounts

**When to use:** Building DAOs, governance systems, voting

#### Basic Patterns
1. **`hello_blockchain/`** - Module structure basics
2. **`message_board/`** - Simple state management
3. **`resource_account/`** - Resource patterns (legacy - avoid for new code)

**When to use:** Learning Move basics, simple contracts

#### Advanced Patterns
1. **`object_playground/`** - Object model exploration
2. **`capability/`** - Capability-based security
3. **`upgradeable/`** - Upgradeable contracts

**When to use:** Complex architectures, security patterns

### Step 3: Review Example Code

**What to look for:**

1. **Module Structure:**
   - How are imports organized?
   - What structs are defined?
   - How are error codes structured?

2. **Object Creation:**
   - How are objects created?
   - Which refs are generated?
   - How is ownership managed?

3. **Access Control:**
   - How is signer authority verified?
   - How is object ownership checked?
   - What roles/permissions exist?

4. **Operations:**
   - How are transfers handled?
   - How are updates secured?
   - What validations are performed?

5. **Testing:**
   - What test patterns are used?
   - How is coverage achieved?

### Step 4: Adapt Patterns to Your Use Case

**Don't copy blindly - adapt:**

1. **Understand the pattern:** Why is it structured this way?
2. **Identify core concepts:** What security checks are critical?
3. **Adapt to your needs:** Modify for your specific requirements
4. **Maintain security:** Keep all security checks intact
5. **Test thoroughly:** Ensure 100% coverage

## How to Access Examples

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface

```
https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples
```

Browse online and read source files directly.

### Option 2: Clone Repository (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone Aptos core
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git

# Navigate to examples
cd aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples

# List all examples
ls -la

# View specific example
cd token_objects
cat sources/token.move
```

### Option 3: Search Aptos Documentation

```
https://aptos.dev/build/smart-contracts
```

Many examples are documented with explanations.

## Common Patterns from Examples

### Pattern 1: Object Creation (from token_objects)

```move
// From: token_objects/sources/token.move
public entry fun create_token(
    creator: &signer,
    collection_name: String,
    description: String,
    name: String,
    uri: String,
) {
    let constructor_ref = token::create_named_token(
        creator,
        collection_name,
        description,
        name,
        option::none(),
        uri,
    );
    // ... additional setup
}
```

**Takeaway:** Use named tokens for collections, create_object for unique items.

### Pattern 2: Access Control (from dao)

```move
// From: dao/sources/dao.move
public entry fun execute_proposal(
    proposer: &signer,
    proposal_id: u64
) acquires DAO, Proposal {
    let dao = borrow_global_mut<DAO>(@dao_addr);
    let proposal = vector::borrow_mut(&mut dao.proposals, proposal_id);

    // Verify proposal passed
    assert!(proposal.votes_for > proposal.votes_against, E_PROPOSAL_NOT_PASSED);

    // Execute actions
    // ...
}
```

**Takeaway:** Verify state conditions before executing critical operations.

### Pattern 3: Transfer Control (from fungible_asset)

```move
// From: fungible_asset/sources/fungible_asset.move
public fun transfer<T: key>(
    from: &signer,
    to: address,
    amount: u64
) acquires FungibleStore {
    // Verify sender has sufficient balance
    let from_store = borrow_global_mut<FungibleStore<T>>(signer::address_of(from));
    assert!(from_store.balance >= amount, E_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE);

    // Deduct from sender
    from_store.balance = from_store.balance - amount;

    // Add to recipient
    let to_store = borrow_global_mut<FungibleStore<T>>(to);
    to_store.balance = to_store.balance + amount;
}
```

**Takeaway:** Check-effects-interactions pattern (verify, deduct, add).

## ALWAYS Rules

- ✅ ALWAYS search examples before writing new contracts
- ✅ ALWAYS prioritize official aptos-core examples
- ✅ ALWAYS understand patterns before copying
- ✅ ALWAYS adapt patterns to your use case
- ✅ ALWAYS maintain security checks from examples
- ✅ ALWAYS reference which example you adapted from
- ✅ ALWAYS test adapted code thoroughly

## NEVER Rules

- ❌ NEVER copy code without understanding it
- ❌ NEVER skip security checks from examples
- ❌ NEVER use deprecated patterns (resource accounts, address-based)
- ❌ NEVER assume examples are always up-to-date (verify against docs)
- ❌ NEVER mix V1 and V2 patterns

## Search Checklist

Before writing contract code:

- [ ] Identified category (NFT, DeFi, DAO, etc.)
- [ ] Found 2-3 relevant examples in aptos-core
- [ ] Reviewed module structure
- [ ] Identified security patterns
- [ ] Understood object creation patterns
- [ ] Noted access control mechanisms
- [ ] Checked test patterns
- [ ] Ready to adapt to my use case

## Example Adaptation Workflow

### Step-by-Step: Building NFT Collection

1. **Search:** Find `token_objects` example
2. **Review Structure:**
   ```
   token_objects/
   ├── sources/
   │   ├── collection.move  # Collection management
   │   ├── token.move       # Token operations
   │   └── property_map.move # Metadata handling
   └── tests/
       └── token_tests.move
   ```

3. **Identify Key Patterns:**
   - Collection creation with `create_collection`
   - Token minting with `create_named_token`
   - Metadata storage using `PropertyMap`
   - Transfer control with `TransferRef`

4. **Adapt to Your Needs:**
   - Keep object creation pattern
   - Keep security checks
   - Add your custom fields
   - Add your business logic
   - Write comprehensive tests

5. **Reference in Code:**
   ```move
   // Adapted from: aptos-core/move-examples/token_objects
   module my_addr::custom_nft {
       // ... your implementation
   }
   ```
